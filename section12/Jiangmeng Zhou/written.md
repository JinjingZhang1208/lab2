Question 1:
The best case complexity for bubble sort is O(n^2) even  if the array is aready sorted in ascending order. The worst case is O(n^2) if the array is in descending order while we need to sort it to ascending order by bubblesort.

Question 2:
We can improve the bubble sort to the version that if the array is already sorted, the best case could be O(n).

Question 3:
The worst case of selection sort is O(n^2). The best case of selection sort is also O(n^2), even the array is sorted already, we need to execute the code for O(n^2).

Question 4:
The selection sort do sorting in place, so it does not need any additional space.

Question 5:
As far as I know, the built-in sorting algorith in C is based on quick sort.So I guess the performance would be close to the performance of quick sort. The time complexity of qsort would be O(nlogn).
