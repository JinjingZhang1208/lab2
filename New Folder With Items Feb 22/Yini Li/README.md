### Important notes

- The code you submit to this lab will be the code that we use for your code walk.
- Your code **should compile and run** on the Khoury machines during code walks. Make sure you test your programs on these machines, as this is where we evaluate your assignments.
- Do not forget, once you have pushed your changes to your repo make sure that you **submit them to Gradescope before the assignment deadline!**
- We will pull your lab code at the late submission deadline to use in the code walk.
