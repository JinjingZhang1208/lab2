## Logistics

For this assignment (and every assignment/lab), you must login into the servers through `your_khoury_name@login.khoury.northeastern.edu` to complete and test your work. 

### Important notes

* The code you submit to this lab will be the code that we use for your code walk. 
* Your code **should compile and run** on the Khoury machines during code walks. Make sure you test your programs on these machines, as this is where we evaluate your assignments.
* Do not forget, once you have pushed your changes to your repo make sure that you **submit them to Gradescope before the assignment deadline!** 
* We will pull your lab code at the late submission deadline to use in the code walk.
